# Firecracker Configuration and Scripts
This directory contains scripts, configuration files and other resources to start firecracker instances locally. This can be useful for testing and debugging purposes, but is not required for the experiments in the cloud. These scripts were used to test the migration process locally before deploying it on Celestial.

Warning: These have not been tested in a while and might not work as expected.
