# Scripts
This directory contains python and bash scripts for:
- Generating figures for the thesis,
- Interacting with a local Redis server.

These are mostly undocumented and a lot of them are not used anymore. They are kept here for reference and possible future use. If you want to generate figures from new data, you can run `./generate.sh`. This is not guaranteed to work on your machine, but it might be a good starting point.
