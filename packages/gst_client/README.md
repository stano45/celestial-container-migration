# Ground Station Client
This is a simulated client which runs on a ground station that:
- Sends random requests to the Redis instance,
- Measures the time it takes for the request to be processed,
- Logs the results in the `client.csv` file.

For building instructions, see the [README](../../celestial-app/README.md) in `celestial-app`.
